This is a project on price prediction of houses using a ensemble method "Random Forest Regression".

Random Forest Regression belongs to the ensemble learning category, which involves training multiple models and combining their predictions to obtain a more accurate and stable result than any individual model. In the case of Random Forests, it combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
